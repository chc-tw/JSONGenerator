Bollinger Bands are a type of trend-following technical indicator that utilizes moving averages to define a price channel. This indicator helps traders identify potential overbought or oversold conditions, as well as price volatility. 

### Components
1. **Middle Band**: A simple moving average (SMA), typically calculated over 20 periods, which serves as the base.
2. **Upper Band**: Positioned above the SMA, calculated as the middle band plus a multiple (commonly 2) of the standard deviation of the asset's price.
3. **Lower Band**: Positioned below the SMA, calculated as the middle band minus a multiple of the standard deviation.

### Interpretation and Usage
- **Volatility Analysis**: The bands expand during high volatility and contract during low volatility. 
- **Mean Reversion**: When prices reach or breach the upper or lower bands, they are considered overbought or oversold, signaling potential mean reversion.
- **Trend Continuation or Reversal**:
  - If price breaks the bands with increasing momentum, it might indicate a trend continuation.
  - If price breaches the band and then returns quickly within, it can signal a reversal.

### Integration into Trading Systems
Bollinger Bands can be:
- Used independently for mean reversion strategies.
- Combined with other indicators like RSI or moving averages to confirm signals and reduce false positives.

### Psychological Considerations
As a tool for mean reversion, Bollinger Bands appeal to traders seeking to capitalize on irrational market behaviors. However, disciplined adherence to entry and exit signals is crucial to success.
