This example shows a strategy form configuration for the N Ticks Bandwidth formula. It checks if the Bollinger Bandwidth values for the past 5 periods (numerator.minusNumber) are all higher than 0 (compareValue). The comparison operator is set to ">" (greater than), indicating that the strategy is looking for situations where the Bandwidth has been consistently above 0 for the specified number of periods. The Bollinger Bands parameters are set to use a 20-period SMA and 2 standard deviations.
