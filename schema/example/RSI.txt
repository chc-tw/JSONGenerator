This example shows a strategy form configuration for the RSI Comparison formula. It checks if the 6-period RSI (numerator.rsiValue) is higher than 15. The comparison operator is set to ">" (greater than), and the compareValue is set to 15, indicating that the strategy is looking for situations where the 6-period RSI is above 15, which could suggest the asset is coming out of oversold territory.
