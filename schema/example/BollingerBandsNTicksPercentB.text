This example shows a strategy form configuration for the N Ticks Percent B (%B) formula. It checks if the %B values for the past 5 periods (numerator.minusNumber) are all higher than 0 (compareValue). The comparison operator is set to ">" (greater than), indicating that the strategy is looking for situations where the %B has been consistently above 0 for the specified number of periods. The Bollinger Bands parameters are set to use a 20-period SMA and 2 standard deviations.
