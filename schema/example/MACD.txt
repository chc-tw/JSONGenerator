This example shows a strategy form configuration for the MACD Comparison formula. It compares the MACD value from the current period (numerator.minusNumber: 0) with the MACD value from 5 periods ago (denominator.minusNumber: 5). The comparison operator is set to ">" (greater than), indicating that the strategy is looking for situations where the current MACD value is higher than the MACD value from 5 periods ago. This could potentially indicate an upward trend or increasing momentum. The MACD parameters are set to the typical values of 12 for the fast period, 26 for the slow period, and 9 for the signal period.
