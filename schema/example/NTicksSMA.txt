This example shows a strategy form configuration for the N Ticks SMA formula. It checks if the Close prices for the past 5 periods (numerator.minusNumber) are all 3% higher than the 20-period SMA (denominator.smaValue). The comparison operator is set to ">" (greater than), and the compareValue is set to 3, indicating that the strategy is looking for situations where the Close prices have consistently been 3% above the 20-period SMA for the last 5 periods.
