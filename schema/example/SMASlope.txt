This example shows a strategy form configuration for the SMA Slope formula. It checks if the slope of the 5-period SMA (numerator.smaValue) calculated from 10 periods ago (numerator.minusNumber) is higher than 45 degrees. The comparison operator is set to ">" (greater than), and the compareValue is set to 45, indicating that the strategy is looking for situations where the SMA slope is steeper than 45 degrees, suggesting a strong upward trend.
