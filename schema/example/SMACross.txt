This example shows a strategy form configuration for the SMA Cross Strategy formula. It represents a golden cross scenario where the 5-period SMA (numerator) crosses above the 20-period SMA (denominator). The comparison operator is set to ">" (greater than), indicating a golden cross. Note that for this strategy, the compareValue is not used, as the crossing is determined by the relative positions of the two SMAs.
