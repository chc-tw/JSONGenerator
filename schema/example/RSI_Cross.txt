This example shows a strategy form configuration for the RSI Cross Strategy formula. It represents a scenario where the 6-period RSI (numerator) crosses above the 12-period RSI (denominator), which is often referred to as a "golden cross" in RSI. The comparison operator is set to ">" (greater than), indicating that the shorter-period RSI is crossing above the longer-period RSI. Note that for this strategy, the compareValue is not used, as the crossing is determined by the relative positions of the two RSI values.
