It checks if the latest Close price (numerator) is the minimum Close price over the past 5 periods (denominator).So, you need to set the minus number for 6 and the comparison operator is set to "<" (less than), indicating that the strategy is looking for situations where the latest price is the minimum price over the specified period.
