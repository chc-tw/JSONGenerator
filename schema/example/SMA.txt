This example shows a strategy form configuration for the SMA compare with SMA formula. It compares the 5-period SMA (numerator) with the 20-period SMA (denominator), both calculated on the current period (minusNumber: 0). The comparison operator is set to ">" (greater than), and the compareValue is set to 5, indicating that the strategy is looking for situations where the 5-period SMA is 5% higher than the 20-period SMA.
